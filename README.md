# AI Music Generation Project

This project uses an LSTM neural network implemented in Keras to generate music.

## Project Overview

The AI Music Generation Project aims to create original musical compositions using machine learning techniques. By leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, we can train models to understand and generate musical patterns.

## Features

- LSTM-based neural network for music generation
- Implemented using Keras and TensorFlow
- Ability to generate MIDI files as output

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Music21 library

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-music-project.git
   cd ai-music-project
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv ai-music-env
   source ai-music-env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `ai-music-env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
